### Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description


**General Overview:**

The aim of this project is to build a real-time chat application using web sockets. You will develop a user interface that allows users to log in and log out, see other logged in users, and message other logged in users using web sockets. The chat application will be designed to be fast, reliable, and scalable.



**Required Components:**

- User Interface: The user interface will be designed to allow users to log in and log out, see other logged in users, and message other logged in users using web sockets. The interface should be easy to use and intuitive.
- Web Socket Server: You will develop a web socket server to handle incoming connections and message transfer between clients. The server will be responsible for keeping track of connected clients, handling incoming messages, and broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
- Authentication and User Management: You will develop an authentication and user management system to handle user login and logout. The system will be responsible for authenticating users and maintaining a list of currently logged in users.
